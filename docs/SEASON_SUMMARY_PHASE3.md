## Security Considerations

### Receipt Generation
- ✅ Only users can generate receipts for their own payments
- ✅ Admins can generate receipts for any family
- ✅ Receipt numbers are based on payment IDs (unique)
- ✅ Test mode prevents accidental email sends
- ⚠️ Email functionality disabled until explicitly enabled

### Invoice Generation
- ✅ Users see only their family's data by default
- ✅ Admins can view all families
- ✅ Organization data is validated

### Data Export
- ✅ Users export only their data
- ✅ Admins can export all organization data
- ✅ Sensitive payment information included only if user has access

## Future Enhancements

### Planned for Phase 4
1. **Automated Email Delivery**
   - Send receipts automatically after payment recording
   - Configurable email templates
   - BCC option for record-keeping

2. **Bulk Operations**
   - Generate all receipts for a season
   - Batch email invoices to all families
   - Bulk export with filtering

3. **Advanced Formatting**
   - PDF generation (currently HTML-based)
   - Custom organization branding/logos
   - Multi-language support

4. **Analytics**
   - Receipt delivery tracking
   - Payment trends by season
   - Late payment identification

## Troubleshooting

### Receipt Not Showing
**Problem**: "Receipt" button doesn't appear for a stay
**Solution**: Ensure the payment has `amount_paid > 0`

### Export Missing Data
**Problem**: Export doesn't include expected columns
**Solution**: Check the export options are toggled on

### Invoice Shows Wrong Dates
**Problem**: Dates appear one day off
**Solution**: This was fixed in the timezone update. If issue persists, verify timezone settings

### Test Email Not Working
**Problem**: "Test Email" button does nothing
**Solution**: This is expected - it shows a toast notification explaining test mode
